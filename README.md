# About

A fan controller that employs a PID instead of a usual P control-loop. This is supposed to improve response times,
reduce ocillations and steady-state error.

# Configuration

The configuration file is hardcoded to /etc/pid-fan-settings.json.

```
{
  //interval of the controller in ms
  //default 500
  "interval":500,

  //heat pressure sources. (devices to be cooled)
  "heat_srcs":[
    {
      //unique identifier of the heat source
      "name":"cpu",
      
      //path to the hwmon temp_input file of the device
      //can contain wildcards but must only resolve to one result.
      "wildcard_path":"/sys/devices/platform/nct6775.*/hwmon/hwmon*/temp1_input",
      
      //parameters of the PID controller

  "fans":[
    {
      //name of the fan, can be ommited
      "name":"cpu fan",

      //can contain wildcards but must only resolve to one result.
      "wildcard_path":"/sys/devices/platform/nct6775.*/hwmon/hwmon*/pwm1",
      
      //minimum pwm value
      "min_pwm":10,
      
      //maximum pwm value
      "max_pwm":255,
      
      //whether to set pwm to 0 when min_pwm is reached.
      //intended for fans which stop spinning before pwm reaches 0
      "cutoff":true,
      
      //heat pressure sources which controll the fan.
      //must only include names of heat pressure sources defined above.
